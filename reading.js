    content: "Good morning! Xiao Ming wakes up in his small House (房子). Next to his bed, there is an Alarm Clock (闹钟) that woke him up. He puts on his Clothes (衣服), Socks (袜子), and Shoes (鞋子). Then he goes to the bathroom. He uses a Toothbrush (牙刷) and Toothpaste (牙膏) to brush his teeth. After that, he washes his hands with Soap (肥皂) and dries them with a soft Towel (毛巾). He looks at himself in the Mirror (镜子) and smiles!\n\nThen it's breakfast time. Mom puts porridge in a Bowl (碗) and eggs on a Plate (盘子). Xiao Ming uses a Spoon (勺子) and a Fork (叉子) to eat. He drinks milk from a red Cup (杯子). After breakfast, Mom gives him a small Gift (礼物) – it's a new Comb (梳子)!\n\nNow it's time to go to School (学校). Xiao Ming takes his School Bag (书包). Inside the bag, there is a Pencil Case (铅笔盒). In the pencil case, there are many things: a Pencil (铅笔), a Pen (钢笔), an Eraser (橡皮擦), a Ruler (尺子), and a colorful Crayon (蜡笔) and Marker (水彩笔). He also puts his new Notebook (笔记本), a Dictionary (字典), a Map (地图), and a small Globe (地球仪) in his bag. He wears his Hat (帽子) because it's sunny outside.\n\nAt school, Xiao Ming meets his kind Teacher (老师). They read a fun Book (书) together. During art class, they draw a big Tree (树) with pink Flower (花) on paper. Xiao Ming uses his Crayon (蜡笔) and Marker (水彩笔) to make the picture beautiful.\n\nAfter school, it starts to rain. Lucky for Xiao Ming, he has a blue Umbrella (雨伞) in his bag! When he gets home, he uses the Key (钥匙) to open the door. Mom is in the kitchen. She is cooking soup in a big Pot (锅) and frying vegetables in a Pan (平底锅) with a Spatula (铲子). There is food in the Fridge (冰箱) and clean clothes in the Washing Machine (洗衣机). For dinner, they use Chopsticks (筷子) to eat delicious rice.\n\nIn the evening, Xiao Ming watches his favorite cartoon on TV (电视) for a little while. Then he uses the Computer (电脑) to play a fun English game. Before bed, he checks the time on his small Watch (手表). Mom calls him with her Phone (手机) to come to bed.\n\nIt's a cold night, so Xiao Ming puts on his warm Gloves (手套) and wraps a soft Scarf (围巾) around his neck when he goes to the living room to say goodnight. What a happy day Xiao Ming has! He knows so many nice things around him, and he loves them all.",
